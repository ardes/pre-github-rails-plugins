= has_types

This plugin allows you to specify the types fro your STI models. This ensures
that all of the types are loaded whenever the base class is loaded, and an
error is raised when a non specified class inherits from a base class.

=== Example

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_types :watch, :pony  # or 'Watch', 'Pony' if you prefer
  end

=== Why?

This has a few benefits:

* All subclasses (types) are loaded when the base class is loaded.  Among other
  benefits, this means that Product.find(:all) will use an SQL clause like 
  <code>products.`type` = 'Product' OR products.`type` = 'Pony' OR product.`type` = 'Watch'</code>

* You don't have to muck about requiring all the model dependencies to avoid weird
  STIness
  
* Your classes are documented that little bit better, and if you forget to add 
  a subclass to :has_types, you'll be told about it.

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
