= has_types

This plugin allows you to specify the types for your STI models. This ensures
that all of the types are loaded whenever find conditions using the subclasses
are constructed, and an error is raised when a non specified class inherits from a base class.

=== Example

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_types :watch, :pony  # or 'Watch', 'Pony' if you prefer
  end
  
  class Bling < Product # => raises error because :bling is not in the above list

=== Why?

This has a few benefits:

* All subclasses (types) are loaded before the type_condition is constructed for
  queries.  This means that Product.find(:all) will use an SQL clause like 
  <code>products.`type` = 'Product' OR products.`type` = 'Pony' OR product.`type` = 'Watch'</code>
  even if you haven't explicitly required 'models/watch' or 'models/pony'

* You don't have to muck about requiring all the model dependencies to avoid weird
  STIness
  
* Your classes are documented that little bit better, and if you forget to add 
  a subclass to :has_types, you'll be told about it.

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
