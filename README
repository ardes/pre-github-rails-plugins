== What's in here:

  README          this file
  Rakefile        contains a 'cruise' task for CI with cruisecontrol.rb, and a
                  'doc' class which builds all plugin documentation (with CI report)
  deprecated/     old plugins
    flatlining/   those plugins I don't expect to pay much more attention to
    with_pulse/   ones that I'll be looking to refactor
  test_app/       for CI with cruisecontrol.rb
    1.2.3/        against rails 1.2.3
    1.2.5/        against rails 1.2.5
    edge/         against rails edge
  template/       A template for plugins - with Rakefile and spec dir set up

  the rest are plugins
  
== The plugins

  All are spec'd using rspec 1.x
  When in a rails plugin directory, run rake --tasks to see how to run specs
  and generate docs
  
== The test app

  The main app is edge, and the other ones symlink edge for many common files
  so it's best to check out test_app/* even if you just want to run the 1.2.x 
  test app
