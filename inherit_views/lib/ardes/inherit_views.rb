    # Specify this in your controller to have its views inherite parent controller's views
    # You can also use a _parent_view_ method in templates which allows view and partials
    # to work like inherited methods (and 'super')
    #
    # Example of controller
    #  
    #   class FooController < ApplicationController
    #     inherit_views
    #   end

    # If your controller inherits from a controller with inherit_views then that controller
    # gets the inherited view paths as well.
