CachedDbFile#timestamped_filename
- should return "#{filename}" when no timestamp (:updated_at, :updated_on) present
- should return "#{filename}_#{timestamp}" with timestamp (:updated_at, :updated_on) and when :filename has no extension
- should return "#{basename}_#{timestamp}.#{ext}" with timestamp (:updated_at, :updated_on) and when :filename has an extension

CachedDbFile :db_file association
- should call #build_db_file when association is nil
- should not call #build_db_file when association exists

CachedDbFile :db_file association (re: delegation)
- should be delegate for #data=
- should be delegate for #data

a new CachedDbFile (with no attributes)
- should not be valid
- should raise error when sent #id_path
- should raise error when sent #cached_filename

a new CachedDbFile (with #filename)
- should be valid
- should create db_file on save

saved CachedDbFile
- should return "#{id/10000}/#{id/100}/#{id}" when sent #id_path (e.g. "0/2/234" if id==234)
- should have #full_filename == "#{cached_db_file_root}/#{plural_model_name}/#{id_path}/#{timestamped_filename}"
- should have #public_filename == "/#{plural_model_name}/#{id_path}/first_#{timestamp}.txt"

saved CachedDbFile (when there is no cached data)
- should access db_file when sent #full_filename
- should create cached file when sent #full_filename
- should create cached file when sent #public_filename
- should create the cached file with the data in db_file.data

saved CachedDbFile (when the data is cached)
- should not access db_file when full_filename called
- should not access db_file when public_filename called
- should remove cached file on destroy
- should remove cached file, and empty enclosing dirs, on update
- should destroy db_file on destroy
- should remove empty enclosing id dirs on remove_cached_file
- should update the cached file when data updated
- should re-cache when timestamp (updated_on, updated_at) has changed

CachedDbFile (when cache file is bad)
- should log exceptions when destroying the cached file
