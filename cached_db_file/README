= cached_db_file

A mixin for caching db_files.

An example of use is where you have a central store of files (say photos) across
a number of apps on different servers.  Each app will suck out the file from the
database only when the cached version is not present.

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
