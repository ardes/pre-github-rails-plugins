= gems

Adapted from technoweenies freeze gems plugin.  This version adds two features:
  (1) gems are unpacked into vendor/gems to make clear what they are
  (2) it's possible to have multiple versions of gems with architecture dependent features

== Usage
  
  rake gems:freeze GEM=gemname [VERSION=version] [ARCH=detect|archname] [TO=dirname]

Running the above task will unpack the named gem into RAILS_ROOT/vendor/gems/ARCH/

If ARCH is unspecified, and the gem has no extensions, the gem will be unpacked into gems/ruby
If ARCH is unspecified, and the gem has extensions, ARCH will be detected and the gem will be unpacked into gems/ARCH.  

The init.rb file loads gems from gems/ARCH and then gems/ruby.

  rake gems:unfreeze GEM=gemname will remove the named gem from all ARCHS
