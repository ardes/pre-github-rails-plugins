* end-to-end tests
* re-introduce :polymorphic option (it can be simulated now - but it's a common use-case for many people)
* add '?' wildcard (which can be used to implement the :polymorphic option)
* write some docs on how RC could be improved by having the resources passed to the controller
* rationalise test suite - make a better app
* stories
* when :in specified, then don't add the load_enclosing wildcard?
