* Now handles enclosing named paths.  You can reference named routes that are
  'below' (or enclosed by) the current resource by appending resource_ to that
  named route. [thanks Chris Hapgood for the initial idea]

* (find|new)_resource(s) methods are now defined by resources_controller_for only
  if they do not already exist

* Better regexp for resources_request [Chris Hapgood]

* Added more specs to get coverage to 100%

* Upgraded to rpsec 0.9, improved Rakefile and specs so that spec:plugins will work

* Removed ApplicationController from spec/app.rb to avoid conflicts with en-
  closing rails application

* Added method_missing proxy to ResourceService, to enable the resource_service
  to be used for things other than find or new (for example Pagination) [Dan Kubb]

* Fixed small error in flash message of destroy action [Dan Kubb]

* Removing experimental cruft

* CHANGELOG started
