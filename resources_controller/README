= rails 1.2.x

I target edge as my development platform, so the specs are written accordingly.

The specs won't pass on rails 1.2.x as the named routes have changed, among
other things.  Some people have reported success on rails 1.2.3 with the latest
version of RC.  

If you're faint hearted, and a rails 1.2.x user you should be using
<= r410 of resources_controller for rails 1.2.3

  http://svn.ardes.com/rails_plugins/resources_controller -r410

If someone wants to maintain a 1.2.x branch of RC, and translate the specs, 
drop me a line.

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
