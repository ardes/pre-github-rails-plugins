= works with rails edge and rails 1.2.5

resources_controller works with rails edge, and 1.2.5.  To check what specific revision of
edge RC has been recently tested against, go to http://plugins.ardes.com/doc/_ci_report.txt

RC probably works fine with rails 1.2.3, but the specs don't pass because of the changes
to named routes.

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
