= resources_controller

plugin to facilitate inheritance and DRYness in your resources controllers

Simple Usage (see Ardes::ResourcesController for more)

  class ThingsController < ApplicationController
    resources_controller_for :things
  end

Also supports nested resources

  class CommentsController < ApplicationController
    resources_controller_for :comments, :in => [:forum, :post]
  end
  
Also support polymorphic associations, and arbitrary nesting

  class TagsController < ApplicationController
    resources_controller_for :tags
    nested_in :taggable, :polymorphic => true, :load_enclosing => true
  end
  
  # this controller will handle
  #   /forums/1/tags
  #   /forums/1/posts/2/tags
  #   /users/3/tags
  # etc

=== For Rails <= 1.2.2

If you are using non-edge rails <= 1.2.2 you should also install
http://svn.ardes.com/rails_plugins/resources_controller_lte_1_2_2

(To tell if you need the patch you can run the specs via rake - if you get failures to do with resource service, then you need the patch)
