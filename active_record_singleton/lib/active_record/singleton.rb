module ActiveRecord#:nodoc:
  # Mixin to make an ActiveRecord class behave in a singleton fashion, having
  # only one row in its associated table.
  #
  # ActiveRecord::Singleton does not, by its nature, support STI (single table inheritance).
  #
  # A Singleton still has a primary key id column, for the following reasons:
  # * the ActiveRecord finders and updaters will work untouched, and
  # * so you can reference the singleton record from other classes (or if the singleton has a has_many relationship) in the usual way.
  #
  # The finders work as expected, but always return the same object (if one is found by the query).
  # 
  # You cannot call destroy on a singleton object
  #
  # You cannot instantiate a Singleton object with <tt>new</tt>, use <tt>instance</tt> or <tt>find</tt>
  #
  # ActiveRecord::Singleton is Thread safe, and handles concurrent access properly (if two separate processes
  # instantiate a Singleton where a table is empty, only one row will be created)
