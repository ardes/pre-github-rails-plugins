= has_scope

if you do this in your model:

  has_scope :published, :find => {:conditions => ['published = ?', true]}, :create => {:published => true}

You get these:

  with_published { # whatever }
  find_published
  find_published_by_title
  count_published
  sum_published(:readers)
  new_published
  destroy_all_published

Basically, when you send a method with '_published' in it a new method will be
constructed with the published scope around it, and that method called.

  
=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
