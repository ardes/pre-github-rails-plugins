# The SaltedHash module
# * should compute a salted hash with compute(algorithm, salt, pass)
# * should compute a salted hash for each supported algorithm
# * should return a random string with salt
# * should convert strings from binary to hexadecimal with binary_to_hex
# * should convert strings from hexadecimal to binary with hex_to_binary
