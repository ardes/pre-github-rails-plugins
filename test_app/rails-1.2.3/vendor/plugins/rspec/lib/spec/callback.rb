# Callback is a fork of Brian Takita's "callback library" (see http://callback.rubyforge.org),
# which Brian graciously contributed to RSpec in order to avoid the dependency.
#
# RSpec uses Callback internally to create hooks to Spec::Runner events. If you're interested
# in a simple, powerful API for generating callback events, check out http://callback.rubyforge.org.
